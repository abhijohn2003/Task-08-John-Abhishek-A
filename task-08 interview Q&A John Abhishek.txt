1. Difference Between Procedure and Function
  = Procedure :
* cannot be used in select.
* to perform a task
    Function :
* can be used in select/where.
* to compute and return value.

2. What is IN/OUT Parameter?
   = IN: Passes a value into the procedure
     OUT: Returns a value out of the procedure.
     INOUT: Passes a value in, and also returns a modified value out.

3. Can Functions Return Tables?
   = No, MySQL functions cannot return tables.

4. What is RETURN Used For?
   = Used in a function to return a value back to the caller.

5. How to Call Stored Procedures?
   = CALL procedure_name(parameters);

6. What is the Benefit of Stored Routines (Procedures/Functions)?
   = Reusability
     Modular Code

7. Can Procedures Have Loops?
   = Yes! MySQL procedures support loops.

8. Difference Between Scalar and Table-Valued Functions
   = Scalar :
* Returns a single value.
     Table-values :

9. What is a Trigger?
   = A trigger is a special procedure that automatically runs in response to certain events     on a table:
    INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

10.How to Debug Stored Procedures?
  = Debugging in MySQL is manual (no built-in debugger), but you can:

* Use SELECT statements to print values step-by-step

* Use MySQL Workbench debugger (in GUI)

* Check the error messages carefully

* Log info into a debug table
